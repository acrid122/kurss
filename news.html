                The leading institutional Web3 summit will kick off in Miami soon — and has attracted high-profile speakers from across TradFi and Web3.

                MiamiWeb3 — which is being held at the InterContinental Hotel from Nov. 28 to 30 — will provide a platform to discuss key trends in this fast-moving sector, as well as policy and where the industry is heading next.

                The city's mayor, Francis Suarez, will be among the attendees — alongside Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has made a name for herself as one of the staunchest cryptocurrency supporters in Congress. She has also played an instrumental role in driving Washington, DC, to enact forward-thinking legislation.

                Both will be joined by the likes of Microsoft Research's Harry Shum, Coinbase Institutional's Senior Advisor, John D’Agostino, S&P Global Ratings’ Chief DeFi Officer Chuck Mounts, Franklin Templeton’s Kevin Farrelly, MoonPay’s Jim Esposito, Circle’s Jared Favole, Blockchain Association's Kristen Smith, Unstoppable Domains’ Sandy Carter, Milken Institute’s Nicole Valentine, famed venture capitalist Tim Draper and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’s CEO Bill Kramer.

                Proof-of-reserves: Can reserve audits avoid another FTX-like moment?
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the wake of the FTX collapse that came about as a result of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange funneling user funds to mitigate its own risks, crypto exchanges came up with a transparency solution called proof-of-reserves. 

                A practice, which was recently endorsed by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, offers a way for exchanges to show provide transparency to users in the absence of clear regulations.
            
                Proof of reserves (PoR) is an independent audit conducted by a third party that seeks to ensure that a custodian holds the assets it claims to own on behalf of its clients. 

                This auditor takes an anonymized snapshot of all balances held and aggregates them into a Merkle tree.

                A Merkle is a cryptographic commitment scheme in which each “leaf,” or node, is labeled with a data block’s cryptographic hash. Their chief use to is to verify data that has been handled, sent or stored between computers. While invented in 1979, the concept has found extensive use in blockchain peer-to-peer networks.

                After taking the snapshot, the auditor obtains a Merkle root: a cryptographic fingerprint that uniquely identifies the combination of these balances at the time when the snapshot was created.

                Nickel Digital, Metaplex and others continue to feel the impact of FTX collapse

            <p>
                Nickel Digital Asset Management is not the only company feeling the effects of FTX’s collapse and bankruptcy. NFT protocol Metaplex also laid off “several members of the Metaplex Studios team” due to the “indirect impact” from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. 
            
                The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan has also had to swallow some losses. According to an announcement made by the Canadian-based teachers’ pension fund, it invested $75 million into FTX International and its US entity, FTX.US. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan shared that the investment “represented less than 0.05%” of its total net assets and “equated to ownership of 0.4% and 0.5% of FTX International and FTX.US, respectively.” Although disappointed by its losses, the pension plan asserts that “the financial loss from this investment will have limited impact on the Plan, given its size relative to our total net assets and our strong financial position.”

                On Nov. 18, Cointelegraph reported that Genesis Block, a frontrunner for providing cryptocurrency retail services in Hong Kong, separate from the institutional cryptocurrency trading services Genesis, will begin closing down its over-the-counter (OTC) online trading portal starting Dec. 10.

                London-based crypto investment firm Nickel Digital Asset Management reported on Nov. 18 that it has around $12 million of its funds stuck on FTX. According to founder and chief investment officer Michael Hall, the company has been unable to withdraw funds, which allegedly account for an estimated 6% of its $200 million in assets under management.

                Banks still show interest in digital assets and DeFi amid market chaos
            </h2>
            <p>
                The cryptocurrency sector is the Wild Wild West in comparison to traditional finance, yet a number of banks are showing interest in digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). This year in particular has been notable for banks exploring digital assets. 

                Most recently, JPMorgan demonstrated how DeFi can be used to improve cross-border transactions. This came shortly after BNY Mellon — America’s oldest bank — announced the launch of its Digital Asset Custody Platform, which allows select institutional clients to hold and transfer Bitcoin 

                BTC $16,497 and Ether ETH $1,174 The Clearing House, a United States banking association and payments company, stated on Nov. 3 that banks “should be no less able to engage in digital-asset-related activities than nonbanks.” Banks aware of potential

                While banks continue to show interest in digital assets, BNY Mellon’s 2022 Survey of Global Institutional Clients highlights increasing demand from institutions seeking access to digital assets through reputable custodians. According to the survey, almost all of the 271 institutional investors (91%) are interested in investing in tokenized assets. The survey also found that most of these investors are using more than one custodian, with 35% conducting business with traditional incumbent players.

                The heightened demand from institutions seeking access to digital assets is one of the reasons why banks are showing interest in cryptocurrency and DeFi offerings.

                Bobby Zagotta, CEO of Bitstamp USA — a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2011 — told Cointelegraph that Bitstamp has received many inbound requests recently for their Bitstamp-as-a-Service offering, which allows fintechs and traditional financial institutions to give clients access to cryptocurrency.

                Crypto self-custody a ‘fundamental human right’ but not risk-free: Community
            </h2>
            <p>
                The FTX debacle sparked an increase in calls for crypto self-custody this week, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao describing it as a “fundamental human right.” However, some warn that there are still risks involved when opting to hold your digital assets on your own. 

                Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, highlighted on Twitter that while the decentralized finance and self-custody ethos were popular this week, there are still risks involved. According to the Ethereum co-founder, bugs in smart contract code are some of these risks. To avoid them, Buterin also mentioned some tips, such as keeping code simple, audits, formal verification and defense in depth.
                
                Apart from smart contract bugs, transferring crypto assets after death also became a topic on social media. Bruce Fenton, an executive at broker Watchdog Capital, brought up some self-custody tests like asking the next of kin to retrieve one’s coins as if they died. According to Fenton, without a plan for its inheritance, self-custody is incomplete. “It’s a gift to no one,” he argued.
